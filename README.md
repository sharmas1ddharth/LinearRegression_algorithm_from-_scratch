## Overview
In the code I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. So, the linear regression shows some relationship and I created this to understand how it works.

## Python Packages Used 
- numpy 

## Usage
run ``python main.py`` to see the results
````
starting gradient descent at b = 0, m = 0, error = 5565.107834483211
After 1000 iterations b = 0.08893651993741346, m = 1.4777440851894448, error = 112.61481011613473
